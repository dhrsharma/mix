Created this repo to store my random work, like easy install scripts or some useful piece of code.

- For now, installscripts folder has a script to install cassandra on macOS.
- Specify cassandra version with the script like `<script> 2.2.8`.
- This script will also modify the `~/.bash_profile` to point to newly installed cassandra.
- Just close and reopen your terminal session to reload `~/.bash_profile` changes.
- And now you cas run cassandra from anywhere with `cassandra -f` that will start cassandra in foreground.
